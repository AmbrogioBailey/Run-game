# Run/Drive Project (my first project!)

This is a quick game that you just press the start button and different emojis(animals or vehicles) will cross the screen. I wanted to keep this project simple so I included a few HTML elements, also imported some text fonts to use. In the CSS I made the background gradient, styled the different text elements along with the button. I also added a hover feature to the button just to intice the user to click the button. I used JavaScript to randomly select an emoji to run (if an animal) or drive (if a vehicle) from the list of emojis I created. I used 'addEventListener' to create a function that moves the emoji accross the screen when the user clicks the start button. I hope you enjoy this and I would appreciate suggestions of things you would want to see me add to this game to make it more interesting.
